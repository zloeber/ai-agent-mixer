    brevity: "medium"
    max_cycles: 10
    starting_agent: "researcher"
    agents_involved:
      - researcher
      - analyst
    turn_timeout: 120
    termination_conditions:
      keyword_triggers:
        - "research complete"
        - "synthesis complete"

        - "final summary"
  
  # Scenario 2: Debate between opposites

    # No agents_involved means all agents participate
    turn_timeout: 120

# Conversation initialization
initialization:
  first_message: "Let's discuss the implications of artificial intelligence in modern education. How is AI transforming learning experiences, what are the opportunities and challenges, and what does the research tell us?"
  
  system_prompt_template: |
    You are {{ agent.name }}, {{ agent.persona }}.
    
    ## Conversation Context
    Scenario: {{ conversation.scenario_name }}
    Goal: {{ conversation.goal }}
    Response Length: Keep your responses {{ conversation.brevity }} ({{ conversation.brevity == "short" and "2-3 sentences" or "4-6 sentences" }}).
    
    {% if agent.metadata %}
    ## Your Profile
    {% if agent.metadata.expertise %}
    Expertise: {{ agent.metadata.expertise | join(", ") }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if agent.metadata.style %}
    Communication Style: {{ agent.metadata.style }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if agent.metadata.perspective %}
    Perspective: {{ agent.metadata.perspective }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if agent.metadata.traits %}
    Key Traits: {{ agent.metadata.traits | join(", ") }}
    {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
    
    ## Instructions
    - Stay in character and maintain your unique perspective
    - Build on previous messages in the conversation
    - Be concise but substantive - every response should add value
    - When appropriate, reference specific points made by other agents
    - Use your expertise to bring unique insights
    {% if conversation.brevity == "short" %}
    - Keep responses crisp and focused (2-3 sentences maximum)
    {% elif conversation.brevity == "medium" %}
    - Balance depth with brevity (4-6 sentences typically)
    {% else %}
    - Provide thorough analysis when needed (6-10 sentences)
    {% endif %}
    
    ## Termination
    When you feel the conversation has reached a natural conclusion for this scenario, you may use one of these phrases:
    {% for keyword in conversation.termination_conditions.keyword_triggers %}
    - "{{ keyword }}"
    {% endfor %}
